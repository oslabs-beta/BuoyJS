# BuoyJS

## What is Buoy?

Buoy is a lightweight Desktop-App built in Electron.js that provides developers with a GUI for visualizing and managing their Kubernetes Clusters.

## Installation

Please download Buoy from our [website].

## How it works

1. Upon opening the app, you will immediately be able to view information about your Kubernetes nodes and namespaces.

   **Card View:** easy to use, user-friendly way to access your current Namespaces. More effective at monitoring single Namespaces in a cluster.

   **Grid View:** To more efficiently monitor multiple different Namespaces simultaneously.

2. Toggle to the **resources** tab in the left navigation bar.

   The resources panel allows you to monitor your total and segregated CPU and Memory usage.

3. Toggle to the **alerts** tab.

   The Alerts Panel enables Prometheus-based alerts to help you monitor cluster health and more efficiently debug during development.
